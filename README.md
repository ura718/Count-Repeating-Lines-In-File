# Count-Repeating-Lines-In-File

Use the msg log file and count up the lines per minutes.  
Basically identify how many lines fall into the same minute and print it out  
  
e.g:  
  read log file example  
  hours:minutes:seconds  
  11:22:01  
  11:22:10  
  11:23:05  

  Output in hours:minutes  
  11:22, 2  <- indicates 2 lines are found at 22 minute  
  11:23, 1  <- indicates 1 line is found at 23 minute
